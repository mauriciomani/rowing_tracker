    "# Creating training images\n",
    "This notebook creates training images from a video, by cutting into the back of the rower only, using the shoulders, hips and nose.\n",
    "Change the **images_per_frame** variable to reduce the amount of images created by the given video.\n",
    "Keep in mind you need to multiply the variables by the size of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images to train a bad back posture\n",
    "Images were extracted from youtube videos with screenshots on the back posture. Plus some mp4 videos, that mainly provide good posture, as mentioned, a lot of bad posture were extracted directly from youtube.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train-test\n",
    "Currently we have a train and test folder inside img. Inside both folders we have **good** and **bad** folders, that include images for good and bad postures. Currently we have inbalanced image dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the notebooks does?\n",
    "The notebook creates images from videos, then you can decide wether that is a good posture or not."
